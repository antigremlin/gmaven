Groovy integration for Apache Maven.

## Supported Versions

* Grovoy 2.x
* Apache Maven 3.x
* Apache Maven 3.1.x

## Features

* Script execution
* GUI console access
* Command-line shell access

## Compilation

GMaven 2.x no longer supports any integration for compilation of Groovy sources.  There were too many problems with
stub-generation and hooking up compliation to the proper Maven lifecycle phases to effectivly support.

For compliation support please see the
[Groovy Eclipse Compiler](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Groovy-Eclipse+compiler+plugin+for+Maven)
or use the [Groovy ant tasks](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Compiling+With+Maven2).
