# Groovy Maven Plugin

See _USAGE_ content for more details.

### Hard Requirements

The Maven and Groovy version requirements are ***hard*** requirements.

When goals are executing the versions of Maven and Groovy are detected.
If they are not compatible the goals will fail with an error.

### Customizing Groovy Version

To customize the version of Groovy the plugin will use, override the `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all` dependency
on the plugin definition in the project.

For example to use Groovy 2.0.6 instead of the default:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.codehaus.groovy</groupId>
          <artifactId>groovy-all</artifactId>
          <version>2.0.6</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </plugin>

There is currently no way to change the Groovy version without a project.
Direct execution of goals will always use the default Groovy version.

### System.exit Forbidden

Use of `java.lang.System.exit`, `java.lang.Runtime.exit` or `java.lang.Runtime.halt` is ***forbidden***
from use by a script execution or evaluation in console or shells.
